# Fretboard

How was that chord played again? Fretboard lets you find guitar chords by typing their name or plotting them into an interactive guitar neck. No matter if you are are a beginner or an advanced player, you can use Fretboard to practice, learn, and master your favorite songs!

## Contributing
Suggestions and contributions are more than welcome. However, please take the following into consideration:

- This project follows the [GNOME Code of Conduct](https://wiki.gnome.org/Foundation/CodeOfConduct).
- Only Flatpak is officially supported.
- The feature set is intentionally restricted. Don't let this discourage you from coming with suggestions, just keep in mind that some things might be technically difficult or out of scope for the app.

The easiest way to contribute is to suggest improvement to the chord database. It works splendidly for popular chords, but has some rough edges. If you get a chord you think is odd when typing a specific name, or don't get the name you'd expect from plotting one into the interactive guitar neck, please [open an issue](https://github.com/bragefuglseth/fretboard/issues).

If you want to contribute major changes, please discuss them beforehand to verify that they are suitable for the project.

## Roadmap

The app is pretty much done at this point. The only new feature that's currently planned is the ability to look up more ways to play a chord.

## Credits
The original chord data is borrowed from T-vK's [Chord Collection](https://github.com/t-vK/chord-collection). I've modified it to fit the needs of this app better.
