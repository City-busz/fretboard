# Fretboard (WIP)

Master any guitar chord. Fretboard lets you look up guitar chords by name or shape.

Mostly functional at this point, but there's a few things that need to be ironed out:

- Tooltips, labels and translation infrastructure
- App metadata
- Weird flickering sometimes when changing chords
