# Fretboard (WIP)

Master any guitar chord. Fretboard lets you look up guitar chords by name or shape.

Currently a WIP! The code is messy in many places, the guitar neck position spin button doesn't really work at all, there is no field to type in chord names, and the barre drawing looks bad in dark mode. All of this will be fixed soonâ„¢.
