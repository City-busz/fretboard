How was that chord played, again? Fretboard lets you find guitar chords by typing their names or plotting them on an interactive guitar neck. When you have identified a chord, you can experiment with changing it, see more ways to play it, or bookmark it to save it for later. No matter if you are a beginner or an advanced guitarist, you can use Fretboard to practice, learn, and master your favorite songs!
