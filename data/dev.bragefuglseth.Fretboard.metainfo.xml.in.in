    <p>
	    How was that chord played, again? Fretboard lets you find guitar chords
	    by typing their names or plotting them on an interactive guitar neck.
      When you have identified a chord, you can experiment with changing it,
      see more ways to play it, or bookmark it to save it for later. No matter
      if you are a beginner or an advanced guitarist, you can use Fretboard to
      practice, learn, and master your favorite songs!
